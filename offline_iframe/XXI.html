                  circumstances other than a disease, injury or external cause
                  classifiable to categories A00-Y89 are recorded as "diagnoses"
                  or "problems". This can arise in two main ways:

                      When a person who may or may not be sick encounters the
                      health services for some specific purpose, such as to
                      receive limited care or service for a current condition,
                      to donate an organ or tissue, to receive prophylactic
                      vaccination or to discuss a problem which is in itself not
                      a disease or injury.

                      When some circumstance or problem is present which
                      influences the person's health status but is not in itself
                      a current illness or injury. Such factors may be elicited
                      during population surveys, when the person may or may not
                      be currently sick, or be recorded as an additional factor
                      to be borne in mind when the person is receiving care for
                      some illness or injury.
