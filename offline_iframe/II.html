                  Categories C76−C80 include malignant neoplasms for which there
                  is no clear indication of the original site of the cancer or

        <p class="chpt-text-last">
                  All neoplasms are classified in this chapter, whether they are
                  functionally active or not. An additional code from Chapter IV
                  may be used, if desired, to identify functional activity
                  associated with any neoplasm. For example,
                  catecholamine-producing malignant phaeochromocytoma of adrenal
                  gland should be coded to C74 with additional code E27.5;
                  basophil adenoma of pituitary gland with Cushing syndrome
                  should be coded to D35.2 with additional code E24.0.

                  3.&nbsp; Morphology
                </p>
        <p class="chpt-text-last">
                  There are a number of major morphological (histological)
                  groups of malignant neoplasms: carcinomas including squamous
                  (cell) and adenocarcinomas; sarcomas; other soft tissue
                  tumours including mesotheliomas; lymphomas (Hodgkin and
                  non-Hodgkin); leukaemia; other specified and site-specific
                  types; and unspecified cancers. Cancer is a generic term and
                  may be used for any of the above groups, although it is rarely
                  applied to the malignant neoplasms of lymphatic,
                  haematopoietic and related tissue. 'Carcinoma' is sometimes
                  used incorrectly as a synonym for 'cancer'.
                </p>
        <p class="chpt-text-last">
                  In Chapter II neoplasms are classified predominantly by site
                  within broad groupings for behaviour. In a few exceptional
                  cases morphology is indicated in the category and subcategory
                  titles.
                </p>
        <p class="chpt-text-last">
                  For those wishing to identify the histological type of
                  neoplasm, comprehensive separate morphology codes are provided
                  (see section Morphology of neoplasms). These morphology codes
                  are derived from the second edition of International
                  Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICDO), which is a
                  dual-axis classification providing independent coding systems
                  for topography and morphology. Morphology codes have six
                  digits: the first four digits identify the histological type;
                  the fifth digit is the behaviour code (malignant primary,
                  malignant secondary (metastatic), in situ, benign, uncertain
                  whether malignant or benign); and the sixth digit is a grading
                  code (differentiation) for solid tumours, and is also used as
                  a special code for lymphomas and leukaemias.

                  4.&nbsp; Use of subcategories in Chapter II
                </p>
        <p class="chpt-text-last">
                  Attention is drawn to the special use of subcategory .8 in
                  this chapter [see note 5]. Where it has been necessary to
                  provide subcategories for 'other', these have generally been
                  designated as subcategory .7.

                  5.&nbsp; Malignant neoplasms overlapping site boundaries and the
                  use of subcategory .8 (overlapping lesion)
                </p>
        <p class="chpt-text-last">
                  Categories C00−C75 classify primary malignant neoplasms
                  according to their point of origin. Many three-character
                  categories are further divided into named parts or
                  subcategories of the organ in question. A neoplasm that
                  overlaps two or more contiguous sites within a three-character
                  category and whose point of origin cannot be determined should
                  be classified to the subcategory .8 ("overlapping lesion"),
                  unless the combination is specifically indexed elsewhere. For
                  example, carcinoma of oesophagus and stomach is specifically
                  indexed to C16.0 (cardia), while carcinoma of the tip and
                  ventral surface of the tongue should be assigned to C02.8. On
                  the other hand, carcinoma of the tip of the tongue extending
                  to involve the ventral surface should be coded to C02.1 as the
                  point of origin, the tip, is known. 'Overlapping' implies that
                  the sites involved are contiguous (next to each other).
                  Numerically consecutive subcategories are frequently
                  anatomically contiguous, but this is not invariably so (e.g.
                  bladder C67.−) and the coder may need to consult anatomical
                  texts to determine the topographical relationships.
                </p>
        <p class="chpt-text-last">
                  Sometimes a neoplasm overlaps the boundaries of
                  three-character categories within certain systems. To take
                  care of this the following subcategories have been designated:

                  In addition to site, morphology and behaviour must also be
                  taken into consideration when coding neoplasms, and reference
                  should always be made first to the Alphabetical Index entry
                  for the morphological description.

                  The introductory pages of Volume 3 include general
                  instructions about the correct use of the Alphabetical Index.
                  The specific instructions and examples pertaining to neoplasms
                  should be consulted to ensure correct use of the categories
                  and subcategories in Chapter II.

                  8.&nbsp; Use of the second edition of International Classification

                  For certain morphological types, Chapter II provides a rather
                  restricted topographical classification, or none at all. The
                  topography codes of ICD-O use for all neoplasms essentially
                  the same three- and four-character categories that Chapter II
                  uses for malignant neoplasms (C00−C77, C80), thus providing
                  increased specificity of site for other neoplasms (malignant
                  secondary (metastatic), benign, in situ and uncertain or
                  unknown).

                  It is therefore recommended that agencies interested in
                  identifying both the site and morphology of tumours, e.g.
                  cancer registries, cancer hospitals, pathology departments and
                  other agencies specializing in cancer, use ICD-O.
