                  A group of disorders characterized by an early onset (usually
                  in the first five years of life), lack of persistence in
                  activities that require cognitive involvement, and a tendency
                  to move from one activity to another without completing any
                  one, together with disorganized, ill-regulated, and excessive
                  activity. Several other abnormalities may be associated.
                  Hyperkinetic children are often reckless and impulsive, prone
                  to accidents, and find themselves in disciplinary trouble
                  because of unthinking breaches of rules rather than deliberate
                  defiance. Their relationships with adults are often socially
                  disinhibited, with a lack of normal caution and reserve. They
                  are unpopular with other children and may become isolated.
                  Impairment of cognitive functions is common, and specific
                  delays in motor and language development are
                  disproportionately frequent. Secondary complications include
                  dissocial behaviour and low self-esteem.

                  Disorders characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern
                  of dissocial, aggressive, or defiant conduct. Such behaviour
                  should amount to major violations of age-appropriate social
                  expectations; it should therefore be more severe than ordinary
                  childish mischief or adolescent rebelliousness and should
                  imply an enduring pattern of behaviour (six months or longer).
                  Features of conduct disorder can also be symptomatic of other
                  psychiatric conditions, in which case the underlying diagnosis
                  should be preferred.
                </p>
        <p>
                  Examples of the behaviours on which the diagnosis is based
                  include excessive levels of fighting or bullying, cruelty to
                  other people or animals, severe destructiveness to property,
                  fire-setting, stealing, repeated lying, truancy from school
                  and running away from home, unusually frequent and severe
                  temper tantrums, and disobedience. Any one of these
                  behaviours, if marked, is sufficient for the diagnosis, but
                  isolated dissocial acts are not.

                  The disorder requires that the overall criteria for F91.- be

                  be accompanied by dissocial or aggressive behaviour that goes

                  Syndromes in which the predominant manifestation is some form
                  of tic. A tic is an involuntary, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic
                  motor movement (usually involving circumscribed muscle groups)
                  or vocal production that is of sudden onset and that serves no
                  apparent purpose. Tics tend to be experienced as irresistible
                  but usually they can be suppressed for varying periods of
                  time, are exacerbated by stress, and disappear during sleep.
                  Common simple motor tics include only eye-blinking,
                  neck-jerking, shoulder- shrugging, and facial grimacing.
                  Common simple vocal tics include throat-clearing, barking,
                  sniffing, and hissing. Common complex tics include hitting
                  oneself, jumping, and hopping. Common complex vocal tics
                  include the repetition of particular words, and sometimes the
                  use of socially unacceptable (often obscene) words
                  (coprolalia), and the repetition of one's own sounds or words
                  (palilalia).

                  A form of tic disorder in which there are, or have been,
                  multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics, although these
                  need not have occurred concurrently. The disorder usually
                  worsens during adolescence and tends to persist into adult
                  life. The vocal tics are often multiple with explosive
                  repetitive vocalizations, throat-clearing, and grunting, and
                  there may be the use of obscene words or phrases. Sometimes
                  there is associated gestural echopraxia which may also be of
                  an obscene nature (copropraxia).

                  A feeding disorder of varying manifestations usually specific

                  refusal and extreme faddiness in the presence of an adequate
                  food supply, a reasonably competent caregiver, and the absence
                  of organic disease. There may or may not be associated
                  rumination (repeated regurgitation without nausea or

                  Persistent eating of non-nutritive substances (such as soil,

                  as autism), or as a relatively isolated psychopathological
                  behaviour; only the latter is classified here. The phenomenon
                  is most common in mentally retarded children and, if mental
                  retardation is also present, F70-F79 should be selected as the

                  Voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, nonfunctional (and often
                  rhythmic) movements that do not form part of any recognized
                  psychiatric or neurological condition. When such movements
                  occur as symptoms of some other disorder, only the overall
                  disorder should be recorded. The movements that are of a non
                  self-injurious variety include: body-rocking, head-rocking,
                  hair-plucking, hair-twisting, finger-flicking mannerisms, and
                  hand-flapping. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviour includes
                  repetitive head-banging, face-slapping, eye-poking, and biting
                  of hands, lips or other body parts. All the stereotyped
                  movement disorders occur most frequently in association with
                  mental retardation (when this is the case, both should be
                  recorded). If eye-poking occurs in a child with visual
                  impairment, both should be coded: eye-poking under this
                  category and the visual condition under the appropriate
                  somatic disorder code.
