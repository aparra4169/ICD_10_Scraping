                  This block contains disorders in which the fundamental
                  disturbance is a change in affect or mood to depression (with
                  or without associated anxiety) or to elation. The mood change
                  is usually accompanied by a change in the overall level of
                  activity; most of the other symptoms are either secondary to,
                  or easily understood in the context of, the change in mood and
                  activity. Most of these disorders tend to be recurrent and the
                  onset of individual episodes can often be related to stressful
                  events or situations.

                  A disorder characterized by a persistent mild elevation of
                  mood, increased energy and activity, and usually marked
                  feelings of well-being and both physical and mental
                  efficiency. Increased sociability, talkativeness,
                  over-familiarity, increased sexual energy, and a decreased
                  need for sleep are often present but not to the extent that
                  they lead to severe disruption of work or result in social
                  rejection. Irritability, conceit, and boorish behaviour may
                  take the place of the more usual euphoric sociability. The
                  disturbances of mood and behaviour are not accompanied by
                  hallucinations or delusions.

                  Mood is elevated out of keeping with the patient's
                  circumstances and may vary from carefree joviality to almost
                  uncontrollable excitement. Elation is accompanied by increased
                  energy, resulting in overactivity, pressure of speech, and a
                  decreased need for sleep. Attention cannot be sustained, and
                  there is often marked distractibility. Self-esteem is often
                  inflated with grandiose ideas and overconfidence. Loss of
                  normal social inhibitions may result in behaviour that is
                  reckless, foolhardy, or inappropriate to the circumstances,
                  and out of character.

                  In typical mild, moderate, or severe depressive episodes, the
                  patient suffers from lowering of mood, reduction of energy,
                  and decrease in activity. Capacity for enjoyment, interest,
                  and concentration is reduced, and marked tiredness after even
                  minimum effort is common. Sleep is usually disturbed and
                  appetite diminished. Self-esteem and self-confidence are
                  almost always reduced and, even in the mild form, some ideas
                  of guilt or worthlessness are often present. The lowered mood
                  varies little from day to day, is unresponsive to
                  circumstances and may be accompanied by so-called "somatic"
                  symptoms, such as loss of interest and pleasurable feelings,
                  waking in the morning several hours before the usual time,
                  depression worst in the morning, marked psychomotor
                  retardation, agitation, loss of appetite, weight loss, and
                  loss of libido. Depending upon the number and severity of the
                  symptoms, a depressive episode may be specified as mild,

                  A disorder characterized by repeated episodes of depression as
                  described for depressive episode (F32.-), without any history
                  of independent episodes of mood elevation and increased energy
                  (mania). There may, however, be brief episodes of mild mood
                  elevation and overactivity (hypomania) immediately after a
                  depressive episode, sometimes precipitated by antidepressant
                  treatment. The more severe forms of recurrent depressive
                  disorder (F33.2 and F33.3) have much in common with earlier
                  concepts such as manic-depressive depression, melancholia,
                  vital depression and endogenous depression. The first episode
                  may occur at any age from childhood to old age, the onset may
                  be either acute or insidious, and the duration varies from a
                  few weeks to many months. The risk that a patient with
                  recurrent depressive disorder will have an episode of mania
                  never disappears completely, however many depressive episodes
                  have been experienced. If such an episode does occur, the
                  diagnosis should be changed to bipolar affective disorder
                  (F31.-).

        <p>
                  A persistent instability of mood involving numerous periods of
                  depression and mild elation, none of which is sufficiently
                  severe or prolonged to justify a diagnosis of bipolar
                  affective disorder (F31.-) or recurrent depressive disorder
                  (F33.-). This disorder is frequently found in the relatives of
                  patients with bipolar affective disorder. Some patients with
                  cyclothymia eventually develop bipolar affective disorder.
