                  This chapter includes symptoms, signs, abnormal results of
                  clinical or other investigative procedures, and ill-defined
                  conditions regarding which no diagnosis classifiable elsewhere
                  is recorded.
                </p>
        <p>
                  Signs and symptoms that point rather definitely to a given
                  diagnosis have been assigned to a category in other chapters
                  of the classification. In general, categories in this chapter
                  include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that,
                  without the necessary study of the case to establish a final
                  diagnosis, point perhaps equally to two or more diseases or to
                  two or more systems of the body. Practically all categories in
                  the chapter could be designated 'not otherwise specified',
                  'unknown etiology' or 'transient'. The Alphabetical Index
                  should be consulted to determine which symptoms and signs are
                  to be allocated here and which to other chapters. The residual
                  subcategories, numbered .8, are generally provided for other
                  relevant symptoms that cannot be allocated elsewhere in the
                  classification.
