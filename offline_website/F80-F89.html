                  The disorders included in this block have in common: (a) onset
                  invariably during infancy or childhood; (b) impairment or
                  delay in development of functions that are strongly related to
                  biological maturation of the central nervous system; and (c) a
                  steady course without remissions and relapses. In most cases,
                  the functions affected include language, visuo-spatial skills,
                  and motor coordination. Usually, the delay or impairment has
                  been present from as early as it could be detected reliably
                  and will diminish progressively as the child grows older,
                  although milder deficits often remain in adult life.

                  Disorders in which normal patterns of language acquisition are
                  disturbed from the early stages of development. The conditions
                  are not directly attributable to neurological or speech

                  retardation, or environmental factors. Specific developmental
                  disorders of speech and language are often followed by
                  associated problems, such as difficulties in reading and
                  spelling, abnormalities in interpersonal relationships, and
                  emotional and behavioural disorders.

                  A disorder in which the child, having previously made normal
                  progress in language development, loses both receptive and
                  expressive language skills but retains general intelligence;
                  the onset of the disorder is accompanied by paroxysmal
                  abnormalities on the EEG, and in the majority of cases also by
                  epileptic seizures. Usually the onset is between the ages of
                  three and seven years, with skills being lost over days or
                  weeks. The temporal association between the onset of seizures
                  and loss of language is variable, with one preceding the other
                  (either way round) by a few months to two years. An
                  inflammatory encephalitic process has been suggested as a
                  possible cause of this disorder. About two-thirds of patients
                  are left with a more or less severe receptive language
                  deficit.

                  The main feature is a specific and significant impairment in
                  the development of reading skills that is not solely accounted
                  for by mental age, visual acuity problems, or inadequate
                  schooling. Reading comprehension skill, reading word
                  recognition, oral reading skill, and performance of tasks
                  requiring reading may all be affected. Spelling difficulties
                  are frequently associated with specific reading disorder and
                  often remain into adolescence even after some progress in
                  reading has been made. Specific developmental disorders of
                  reading are commonly preceded by a history of disorders in
                  speech or language development. Associated emotional and
                  behavioural disturbances are common during the school age
                  period.

                  of specific reading disorder, which is not solely accounted
                  for by low mental age, visual acuity problems, or inadequate
                  schooling. The ability to spell orally and to write out words
                  correctly are both affected.

                  A type of pervasive developmental disorder that differs from
                  childhood autism either in age of onset or in failing to
                  fulfil all three sets of diagnostic criteria. This subcategory
                  should be used when there is abnormal and impaired development
                  that is present only after age three years, and a lack of
                  sufficient demonstrable abnormalities in one or two of the
                  three areas of psychopathology required for the diagnosis of
                  autism (namely, reciprocal social interactions, communication,
                  and restricted, stereotyped, repetitive behaviour) in spite of
                  characteristic abnormalities in the other area(s). Atypical
                  autism arises most often in profoundly retarded individuals
                  and in individuals with a severe specific developmental
                  disorder of receptive language.

                  A condition, so far found only in girls, in which apparently
                  normal early development is followed by partial or complete
                  loss of speech and of skills in locomotion and use of hands,
                  together with deceleration in head growth, usually with an
                  onset between seven and 24 months of age. Loss of purposive
                  hand movements, hand-wringing stereotypies, and
                  hyperventilation are characteristic. Social and play
                  development are arrested but social interest tends to be
                  maintained. Trunk ataxia and apraxia start to develop by age
                  four years and choreoathetoid movements frequently follow.
                  Severe mental retardation almost invariably results.

                  the disorder, followed by a definite loss of previously
                  acquired skills in several areas of development over the
                  course of a few months. Typically, this is accompanied by a
                  general loss of interest in the environment, by stereotyped,
                  repetitive motor mannerisms, and by autistic-like
                  abnormalities in social interaction and communication. In some
                  cases the disorder can be shown to be due to some associated
                  encephalopathy but the diagnosis should be made on the
                  behavioural features.

                  An ill-defined disorder of uncertain nosological validity. The
                  category is designed to include a group of children with
                  severe mental retardation (IQ below 35) who show major
                  problems in hyperactivity and in attention, as well as
                  stereotyped behaviours. They tend not to benefit from
                  stimulant drugs (unlike those with an IQ in the normal range)
                  and may exhibit a severe dysphoric reaction (sometimes with
                  psychomotor retardation) when given stimulants. In
                  adolescence, the overactivity tends to be replaced by
                  underactivity (a pattern that is not usual in hyperkinetic
                  children with normal intelligence). This syndrome is also
                  often associated with a variety of developmental delays,
                  either specific or global. The extent to which the behavioural
                  pattern is a function of low IQ or of organic brain damage is
                  not known.

                  A disorder of uncertain nosological validity, characterized by
                  the same type of qualitative abnormalities of reciprocal
                  social interaction that typify autism, together with a
                  restricted, stereotyped, repetitive repertoire of interests
                  and activities. It differs from autism primarily in the fact
                  that there is no general delay or retardation in language or
                  in cognitive development. This disorder is often associated
                  with marked clumsiness. There is a strong tendency for the
                  abnormalities to persist into adolescence and adult life.
                  Psychotic episodes occasionally occur in early adult life.
