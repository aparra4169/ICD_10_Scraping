                  A group of disorders in which anxiety is evoked only, or
                  predominantly, in certain well-defined situations that are not
                  currently dangerous. As a result these situations are
                  characteristically avoided or endured with dread. The
                  patient's concern may be focused on individual symptoms like
                  palpitations or feeling faint and is often associated with
                  secondary fears of dying, losing control, or going mad.
                  Contemplating entry to the phobic situation usually generates
                  anticipatory anxiety. Phobic anxiety and depression often
                  coexist. Whether two diagnoses, phobic anxiety and depressive
                  episode, are needed, or only one, is determined by the time
                  course of the two conditions and by therapeutic considerations
                  at the time of consultation.

                  A fairly well-defined cluster of phobias embracing fears of
                  leaving home, entering shops, crowds and public places, or
                  travelling alone in trains, buses or planes. Panic disorder is
                  a frequent feature of both present and past episodes.
                  Depressive and obsessional symptoms and social phobias are
                  also commonly present as subsidiary features. Avoidance of the
                  phobic situation is often prominent, and some agoraphobics
                  experience little anxiety because they are able to avoid their
                  phobic situations.

                  associated with low self-esteem and fear of criticism. They
                  may present as a complaint of blushing, hand tremor, nausea,
                  or urgency of micturition, the patient sometimes being
                  convinced that one of these secondary manifestations of their
                  anxiety is the primary problem. Symptoms may progress to panic
                  attacks.

                  The essential feature is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety
                  (panic), which are not restricted to any particular situation
                  or set of circumstances and are therefore unpredictable. As
                  with other anxiety disorders, the dominant symptoms include
                  sudden onset of palpitations, chest pain, choking sensations,
                  dizziness, and feelings of unreality (depersonalization or
                  derealization). There is often also a secondary fear of dying,
                  losing control, or going mad. Panic disorder should not be
                  given as the main diagnosis if the patient has a depressive
                  disorder at the time the attacks start; in these circumstances
                  the panic attacks are probably secondary to depression.

                  The essential feature is recurrent obsessional thoughts or
                  compulsive acts. Obsessional thoughts are ideas, images, or
                  impulses that enter the patient's mind again and again in a
                  stereotyped form. They are almost invariably distressing and
                  the patient often tries, unsuccessfully, to resist them. They
                  are, however, recognized as his or her own thoughts, even
                  though they are involuntary and often repugnant. Compulsive
                  acts or rituals are stereotyped behaviours that are repeated
                  again and again. They are not inherently enjoyable, nor do
                  they result in the completion of inherently useful tasks.
                  Their function is to prevent some objectively unlikely event,
                  often involving harm to or caused by the patient, which he or
                  she fears might otherwise occur. Usually, this behaviour is
                  recognized by the patient as pointless or ineffectual and
                  repeated attempts are made to resist. Anxiety is almost
                  invariably present. If compulsive acts are resisted the
                  anxiety gets worse.

                  These may take the form of ideas, mental images, or impulses
                  to act, which are nearly always distressing to the subject.
                  Sometimes the ideas are an indecisive, endless consideration
                  of alternatives, associated with an inability to make trivial
                  but necessary decisions in day-to-day living. The relationship
                  between obsessional ruminations and depression is particularly
                  close and a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder should
                  be preferred only if ruminations arise or persist in the
                  absence of a depressive episode.

                  The majority of compulsive acts are concerned with cleaning
                  (particularly handwashing), repeated checking to ensure that a
                  potentially dangerous situation has not been allowed to
                  develop, or orderliness and tidiness. Underlying the overt
                  behaviour is a fear, usually of danger either to or caused by
                  the patient, and the ritual is an ineffectual or symbolic
                  attempt to avert that danger.

                  This category differs from others in that it includes
                  disorders identifiable on the basis of not only symptoms and
                  course but also the existence of one or other of two causative
                  influences: an exceptionally stressful life event producing an
                  acute stress reaction, or a significant life change leading to
                  continued unpleasant circumstances that result in an
                  adjustment disorder. Although less severe psychosocial stress
                  ("life events") may precipitate the onset or contribute to the
                  presentation of a very wide range of disorders classified
                  elsewhere in this chapter, its etiological importance is not
                  always clear and in each case will be found to depend on
                  individual, often idiosyncratic, vulnerability, i.e. the life
                  events are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the
                  occurrence and form of the disorder. In contrast, the
                  disorders brought together here are thought to arise always as
                  a direct consequence of acute severe stress or continued
                  trauma. The stressful events or the continuing unpleasant
                  circumstances are the primary and overriding causal factor and
                  the disorder would not have occurred without their impact. The
                  disorders in this section can thus be regarded as maladaptive
                  responses to severe or continued stress, in that they
                  interfere with successful coping mechanisms and therefore lead
                  to problems of social functioning.

                  A transient disorder that develops in an individual without
                  any other apparent mental disorder in response to exceptional
                  physical and mental stress and that usually subsides within
                  hours or days. Individual vulnerability and coping capacity
                  play a role in the occurrence and severity of acute stress
                  reactions. The symptoms show a typically mixed and changing
                  picture and include an initial state of "daze" with some
                  constriction of the field of consciousness and narrowing of
                  attention, inability to comprehend stimuli, and
                  disorientation. This state may be followed either by further
                  withdrawal from the surrounding situation (to the extent of a
                  dissociative stupor - F44.2), or by agitation and
                  over-activity (flight reaction or fugue). Autonomic signs of
                  panic anxiety (tachycardia, sweating, flushing) are commonly
                  present. The symptoms usually appear within minutes of the
                  impact of the stressful stimulus or event, and disappear
                  within two to three days (often within hours). Partial or
                  complete amnesia (F44.0) for the episode may be present. If
                  the symptoms persist, a change in diagnosis should be
                  considered.

                  Arises as a delayed or protracted response to a stressful
                  event or situation (of either brief or long duration) of an
                  exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which is
                  likely to cause pervasive distress in almost anyone.
                  Predisposing factors, such as personality traits (e.g.
                  compulsive, asthenic) or previous history of neurotic illness,
                  may lower the threshold for the development of the syndrome or
                  aggravate its course, but they are neither necessary nor
                  sufficient to explain its occurrence. Typical features include
                  episodes of repeated reliving of the trauma in intrusive
                  memories ("flashbacks"), dreams or nightmares, occurring
                  against the persisting background of a sense of "numbness" and
                  emotional blunting, detachment from other people,
                  unresponsiveness to surroundings, anhedonia, and avoidance of
                  activities and situations reminiscent of the trauma. There is
                  usually a state of autonomic hyperarousal with hypervigilance,
                  an enhanced startle reaction, and insomnia. Anxiety and
                  depression are commonly associated with the above symptoms and
                  signs, and suicidal ideation is not infrequent. The onset
                  follows the trauma with a latency period that may range from a
                  few weeks to months. The course is fluctuating but recovery
                  can be expected in the majority of cases. In a small
                  proportion of cases the condition may follow a chronic course
                  over many years, with eventual transition to an enduring
                  personality change (F62.0).

                  States of subjective distress and emotional disturbance,
                  usually interfering with social functioning and performance,
                  arising in the period of adaptation to a significant life
                  change or a stressful life event. The stressor may have
                  affected the integrity of an individual's social network
                  (bereavement, separation experiences) or the wider system of
                  social supports and values (migration, refugee status), or
                  represented a major developmental transition or crisis (going
                  to school, becoming a parent, failure to attain a cherished
                  personal goal, retirement). Individual predisposition or
                  vulnerability plays an important role in the risk of
                  occurrence and the shaping of the manifestations of adjustment
                  disorders, but it is nevertheless assumed that the condition
                  would not have arisen without the stressor. The manifestations
                  vary and include depressed mood, anxiety or worry (or mixture
                  of these), a feeling of inability to cope, plan ahead, or
                  continue in the present situation, as well as some degree of
                  disability in 9the performance of daily routine. Conduct
                  disorders may be an associated feature, particularly in
                  adolescents. The predominant feature may be a brief or
                  prolonged depressive reaction, or a disturbance of other
                  emotions and conduct.

                  The common themes that are shared by dissociative or
                  conversion disorders are a partial or complete loss of the
                  normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of
                  identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily
                  movements. All types of dissociative disorders tend to remit
                  after a few weeks or months, particularly if their onset is
                  associated with a traumatic life event. More chronic
                  disorders, particularly paralyses and anaesthesias, may
                  develop if the onset is associated with insoluble problems or
                  interpersonal difficulties. These disorders have previously
                  been classified as various types of "conversion hysteria".
                  They are presumed to be psychogenic in origin, being
                  associated closely in time with traumatic events, insoluble
                  and intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. The
                  symptoms often represent the patient's concept of how a
                  physical illness would be manifest. Medical examination and
                  investigation do not reveal the presence of any known physical
                  or neurological disorder. In addition, there is evidence that
                  the loss of function is an expression of emotional conflicts
                  or needs. The symptoms may develop in close relationship to
                  psychological stress, and often appear suddenly. Only
                  disorders of physical functions normally under voluntary
                  control and loss of sensations are included here. Disorders
                  involving pain and other complex physical sensations mediated
                  by the autonomic nervous system are classified under
                  somatization disorder (F45.0). The possibility of the later
                  appearance of serious physical or psychiatric disorders should
                  always be kept in mind.

                  The main feature is loss of memory, usually of important
                  recent events, that is not due to organic mental disorder, and
                  is too great to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness or
                  fatigue. The amnesia is usually centred on traumatic events,
                  such as accidents or unexpected bereavements, and is usually
                  partial and selective. Complete and generalized amnesia is
                  rare, and is usually part of a fugue (F44.1). If this is the
                  case, the disorder should be classified as such. The diagnosis
                  should not be made in the presence of organic brain disorders,
                  intoxication, or excessive fatigue.

                  Dissociative fugue has all the features of dissociative
                  amnesia, plus purposeful travel beyond the usual everyday
                  range. Although there is amnesia for the period of the fugue,
                  the patient's behaviour during this time may appear completely
                  normal to independent observers.

                  Dissociative stupor is diagnosed on the basis of a profound
                  diminution or absence of voluntary movement and normal
                  responsiveness to external stimuli such as light, noise, and
                  touch, but examination and investigation reveal no evidence of
                  a physical cause. In addition, there is positive evidence of
                  psychogenic causation in the form of recent stressful events
                  or problems.

                  bodily functions, rather than medical knowledge. There may be

                  The main features are multiple, recurrent and frequently
                  changing physical symptoms of at least two years duration.
                  Most patients have a long and complicated history of contact
                  with both primary and specialist medical care services, during
                  which many negative investigations or fruitless exploratory
                  operations may have been carried out. Symptoms may be referred
                  to any part or system of the body. The course of the disorder
                  is chronic and fluctuating, and is often associated with
                  disruption of social, interpersonal, and family behaviour.
                  Short-lived (less than two years) and less striking symptom
                  patterns should be classified under undifferentiated
                  somatoform disorder (F45.1).

                  The essential feature is a persistent preoccupation with the
                  possibility of having one or more serious and progressive
                  physical disorders. Patients manifest persistent somatic
                  complaints or a persistent preoccupation with their physical
                  appearance. Normal or commonplace sensations and appearances
                  are often interpreted by patients as abnormal and distressing,
                  and attention is usually focused upon only one or two organs
                  or systems of the body. Marked depression and anxiety are
                  often present, and may justify additional diagnoses.

                  Symptoms are presented by the patient as if they were due to a
                  physical disorder of a system or organ that is largely or
                  completely under autonomic innervation and control, i.e. the
                  cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and urogenital
                  systems. The symptoms are usually of two types, neither of
                  which indicates a physical disorder of the organ or system
                  concerned. First, there are complaints based upon objective
                  signs of autonomic arousal, such as palpitations, sweating,
                  flushing, tremor, and expression of fear and distress about
                  the possibility of a physical disorder. Second, there are
                  subjective complaints of a nonspecific or changing nature such
                  as fleeting aches and pains, sensations of burning, heaviness,
                  tightness, and feelings of being bloated or distended, which
                  are referred by the patient to a specific organ or system.

                  The predominant complaint is of persistent, severe, and
                  distressing pain, which cannot be explained fully by a
                  physiological process or a physical disorder, and which occurs
                  in association with emotional conflict or psychosocial
                  problems that are sufficient to allow the conclusion that they
                  are the main causative influences. The result is usually a
                  marked increase in support and attention, either personal or
                  medical. Pain presumed to be of psychogenic origin occurring

                  Considerable cultural variations occur in the presentation of
                  this disorder, and two main types occur, with substantial
                  overlap. In one type, the main feature is a complaint of
                  increased fatigue after mental effort, often associated with
                  some decrease in occupational performance or coping efficiency
                  in daily tasks. The mental fatiguability is typically
                  described as an unpleasant intrusion of distracting
                  associations or recollections, difficulty in concentrating,
                  and generally inefficient thinking. In the other type, the
                  emphasis is on feelings of bodily or physical weakness and
                  exhaustion after only minimal effort, accompanied by a feeling
                  of muscular aches and pains and inability to relax. In both
                  types a variety of other unpleasant physical feelings is
                  common, such as dizziness, tension headaches, and feelings of
                  general instability. Worry about decreasing mental and bodily
                  well-being, irritability, anhedonia, and varying minor degrees
                  of both depression and anxiety are all common. Sleep is often
                  disturbed in its initial and middle phases but hypersomnia may
                  also be prominent.

                  A rare disorder in which the patient complains spontaneously
                  that his or her mental activity, body, and surroundings are
                  changed in their quality, so as to be unreal, remote, or
                  automatized. Among the varied phenomena of the syndrome,
                  patients complain most frequently of loss of emotions and
                  feelings of estrangement or detachment from their thinking,
                  their body, or the real world. In spite of the dramatic nature
                  of the experience, the patient is aware of the unreality of
                  the change. The sensorium is normal and the capacity for
                  emotional expression intact. Depersonalization-derealization
                  symptoms may occur as part of a diagnosable schizophrenic,
                  depressive, phobic, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. In such
                  cases the diagnosis should be that of the main disorder.
